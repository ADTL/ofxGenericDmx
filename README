USAGE
This addon requires libftdi.
On OSX, an easy way to install the library is by using macports.
After macports has been installed, issue the following command to install
libftdi as a universal library: 'sudo port install libftdi +universal'.
A similar process will probably work on linux as well, although the two paths
mentioned below might need to be changed.

The library path is /opt/local/lib/libftdi.dylib. This has already been added to
the addon.

What you need to do yourself is adding the include path.
In the Project menu, choose 'Edit project settings' and select the Build tab.
Enter 'User Header Search Paths' (partially) in the search field in order to
locate that property. Double click it and add the path '/opt/local/include'.

The addon should now compile just fine.

Note: if the addon compiles, appears to open a device but does not send any data,
it is likely you have the Ftdi VCP installed. You can determine this by checking
if /dev/ttyUsbSerial exists. Arduino software also installs this driver.
A temporary solution is to uninstall the driver (see Ftdi's installation guide).


NOTES
- Make sure to install libusb, libusb-compat and libftdi as universal libraries.
  (command: 'sudo port install libftdi +universal')
- libftdi has a C++ wrapper; it depends on Boost however, so it isn't used in
  this addon.
- DmxRawDevice is untested.
- by lack of RDM-capable devices to test with, such features have not been added.
