This addon is built to control any DMX device, including the Enttec DMX USB PRO and 'simpler' devices.

USAGE
This addon requires libftdi, libusb-compat and libusbx.
For OSX and GNU/Linux, these have been included in the addon so you should not
need any external files. However, you might need to add the relevant library
paths to your project configuration.
The included version of libftdi is 0.20, the version of libusbx is 1.0.12.

It is also possible to use macports or a similar ports manager; in that case,
it is important to create universal libraries. Besides you will of course have
to add the proper include paths.

The addon should work on any platform supported by the required libraries, this
includes Windows. However, some work needs to be done to get there.


NOTES
- (OSX specific) If the addon compiles, appears to open a device but does not
  send any data, it is likely you have the Ftdi VCP driver installed. This can
	be determined by checking if /dev/ttyUsbSerial exists.
	Note that the Arduino software also installs this driver. A temporary solution
	is to uninstall the driver (see Ftdi's installation guide:
	http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm).
- Should you choose to install your own libraries, make sure to install them all
  as universal libraries. (e.g., OSX macports command would be:
	'sudo port install libftdi +universal')
- While setting up a Code::Blocks project, the libraries will have to be added
  to link against. Make sure they end up in the right order: first libftdi, then
	libusb-compat and finally usb-1.0.
- libftdi has a C++ wrapper; it depends on Boost however, so it isn't used in
  this addon to avoid additional dependencies.
- DmxRawDevice is untested.
- by lack of RDM-capable devices to test with, such features have not been added.
- to recompile the libraries this addon depends on, please see
  scripts/building-libs-howto.txt.
