USAGE
This addon requires libftdi, libusb-compat and libusb-1.0.
For OSX, these have been included in the addon so you should not need any
external files. However, you might need to add the three relevant library paths
to your project configuration.

It is also possible to use macports or a similar ports manager; in that case, it
is important to create universal libraries. Besides you will have to add the
proper include paths.

The addon should work on Linux and Windows as well since all required libraries
are cross-platform.


NOTES
- (OSX specific) If the addon compiles, appears to open a device but does not
  send any data, it is likely you have the Ftdi VCP driver installed. This can
	be determined by checking if /dev/ttyUsbSerial exists.
	Note that the Arduino software also installs this driver. A temporary solution
	is to uninstall the driver (see Ftdi's installation guide:
	http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/InstallGuides.htm).
- Make sure to install libusb, libusb-compat and libftdi as universal libraries.
  (e.g., OSX macports command would be: 'sudo port install libftdi +universal')
- libftdi has a C++ wrapper; it depends on Boost however, so it isn't used in
  this addon to avoid additional dependencies.
- DmxRawDevice is untested.
- by lack of RDM-capable devices to test with, such features have not been added.
