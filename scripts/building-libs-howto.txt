For OSX and GNU/Linux, the build-libs.sh script should auto-detect your OS and
build the required library files; on windows, build-libs.bat should build the
required files.
If necessary, correct version numbers and possibly download URLs in the script
files and after running them, copy the resultant files to their proper
locations (directory structure matches that of ofxGenericDmx).
